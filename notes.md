# Notes

## EC2
- Elastic IP allows you to keep the same IP address even if you restart the ec2 instance
- Make sure to RELEASE the elastic IP when I'm done, or I'll keep getting charged.

## HTML
- Run this command to deploy the html files `./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup`

## CSS
- Use @media to detect when the screen is a certain size
