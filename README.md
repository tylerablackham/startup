## Startup Specification - TuneTransfer

### What is TuneTransfer?
The goal of TuneTransfer is to make sharing music easier. There are many different music streaming services like Apple
Music, Spotify, Youtube Music, Amazon Music, and many more. For the sake of simplicity, TuneTransfer will first focus on
Apple Music and Spotify, two of the most popular services out there. TuneTransfer will help you take playlists that you 
have created or listened to on one streaming service and create a copy of that playlist on another streaming service, 
provided one has an account for both streaming services. It will also be able to keep track of said playlists so that
the user can manually update the copied playlist. By doing this, TuneTransfer will allow people who favor or primarily 
use different streaming services to more easily share music with each other.
